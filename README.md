# Project Goal
The goal of this project is to build a Flask web page / dash board showcasing data on dogecoin and tweets from Elon Musk. Dogecoin has become quite popular lately, but the price has gone stagnant. To me, it seemed like the only thing that would boost the price was a tweet from Musk. Not everytime, of course, but it seemed more than 50/50.

So is it? How many of dogecoin rocket rides are because Musk tweeted out the launch time. Using this repo will create a local or deployable web server curating financial information about dogecoin prices and information about Elon Musk's tweets. This project will primarily be a dashboard with several components:

1. Has Elon tweeted about dogecoin recently (last 12 hours)?
2. What is the current price of dogecoin and is trending up or down (last 12 hours)?
3. When has Elon tweeted about dogecoin along a timeline of dogecoin prices. How many rises had a tweet impetus?
